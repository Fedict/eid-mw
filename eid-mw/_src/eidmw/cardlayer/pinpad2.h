/*
 * This API should be implemented by libraries (also called
 * plugins) that want to support a pinpad reader for use
 * with the eID middleware.
 *
 * The middleware has support for CCID readers; see the PCSC V2
 * part 10 standard and the USB CCID specifications.
 *
 * However these standards don't specify how to display messages
 * on the reader's display. Because the middleware will show a
 * some explanation on the PC whenever a pinpad operation needs
 * to be done, this restriction is not important for pinpad
 * readers without display.
 *
 * But for readers with display, it is important that the correct
 * message be displayed, as to avoid confusion between the different
 * PINs on the eID card and the fact that the "PIN change command"
 * is used for both PIN change and PIN unblock.
 *
 * In this case, as well as for non-CCID pinpad readers or readers
 * that offer extra functionality, a library (a DLL on Windows, an
 * .so file on Linux and a .dylib file on Mac) can be made that
 * exports the 2 functions below.
 * The middleware will first try to load this library and check if
 * it can be used by mean of the EIDMW_PP_Init() function. If so, then
 * all pinpad functionality will be requested  through this library.
 *
 * To allow the middleware to find the library, it must be placed in
 * the following directory:
 *   - On Linux and Mac OS X: /usr/local/lib/beidpp
 *   - On Windows: <systemdir>\beidpp
 *     (<systemdir> is the Windows system folder, usually this is
 *      C:\WINDOWS\system32 on WinXP and Vista)
 * And the name of the library should start with "beidpp2" on
 * Windows, and with "libbeidpp2" on Linux and Mac.
 *
 * Future, incompatible versions of this library will start with
 * "beidpp3" etc.
 *
 * Remark: for the middleware for other country, "beid" should be
 * replace by e.g. "pteid", "ileid", ...

 *
 * - ucMinorVersion: (IN) indicates a change in the API that is compatible with other
 *     ucMinorVersions of this library, current value = PTEID_MINOR_VERSION.
 * - hCtx: (IN) the SCARDCONTEXT handle that was obtained by a call to SCardEstablishContext()
 * - hCard: (IN) the SCARDHANDLE that was obtained by a call to SCardConnect()
 * - csReader: (IN) the PCSC reader name as obtained by a call to SCardListReaders()
 * - ulLanguage: (IN) USB LANGID code (http://www.usb.org/developers/docs) for the language
 *      of the messages to be displayed on the pinpad reader
 *      Examples are 0x0409 for English (UK), 0x0813 for Dutch (BE),
 *        0x080c for French (BE), 0x0407 for German.
 * - pGuiInfo: (OUT) strings to be displayed on PC before each pinpad operation,
 *      leave them unchanged (NULL) to use the default strings. The size that has
 *      been allocated for each string is 2000 (DLG_INFO_CHARS) bytes.
 *      Set to "r" if nothing should be displayed on the PC (the pinpad lib will
 *      take care of this).
 * - ulRfu: reserved for future use, set to 0 for this ucMinorVersion
 * - pRfu: reserved for future use, set to NULL for this ucMinorVersion
 *
 * Returns SCARD_ERROR_SUCCESS upon success, or another (preferably PCSC) error if this pinpad
 * library doesn't support this reader or something else went wrong.
 * In the case SCARD_ERROR_SUCCESS is returned, this pinpad library will be used
 * by the middleware for pinpad operation. Otherwise, the middleware will continue
 * searching for other pinpad libraries that may support this reader.
