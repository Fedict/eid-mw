/**
 * A pinpad lib is a DLL, SO file or DYLIB that implements
 * and export the 2 functions in pinpad2.h (or another
 * pinpad API that should be supported).
 * See pinpad2.h for more info about the functions and
 * the requirements for such pinpad libs.
 * This class takes care of searching and using a pinpad
 * lib for a specific type of eID card and a specific
 * type of pinpad reader: all pinpad libs for that specific
 * eID card are searched and are loaded in order to check
 * if they support the pinpad reader in question.
