// This interface is primarily here for FIPS testing.  It creates an RSA key with the various "random" numbers
// supplied as parameters; calling the same routines as the "generate" function in the same sequence.  It
// doesn't test the suitability of the numbers since the FIPS KAT tests provide "good" numbers from which to
// make keys.
//
// In addition this routine passes back the RSA key components if space is passed in to return the values.
// This is done here so that the proper "P" and "Q" values are returned, since we'll always put the largest
// value into P to work with the remainder of the math in this package.  Keys constructed in this manner
// behave the same as keys with no ordering for P & Q.
