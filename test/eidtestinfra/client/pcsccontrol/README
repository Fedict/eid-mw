#       JAXB        #
#####################

The schema files (*.xsd) are compiled using XJC, part of the jaxb package.
The XJC builder is switched off by default. To build the schema files, select:

Project > properties > Builders

Place a mark in the XJC check box and build the project.

Compiling control.xsd and scard.xsd with XJC will generate:

Card.java
Control.java
ObjectFactory.java

After you have successfully ran XJC on the schema files it is best to switch off
the builder again so that future builds run quicker.

Note that JAXB is part of Java 1.6. The lib directory contains jar files that allow
the gui to run under Java 1.5.

#     build.xml     #

Do not manually alter the build.xml file. Instead have Eclipse generate it. Select:

File > Export... > Ant Buildfiles

#  makeJarFile.xml  #
#####################

This file is not generated and so you have to manually make changes. It is important
that you step the version contained by attribute "Implementation-Version". The following
attributes are displayed in the Gui's about box:

Implementation-Title
Implementation-Vendor
Implementation-Version

#  logging          #

To turn on logging, a log4j.conf file should be put
in the current dir. See the log4j.conf for an example
of what the file can contain.
