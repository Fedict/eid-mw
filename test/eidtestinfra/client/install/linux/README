BE eID Test Infrastructure
==========================

This software helps you test your developments for the
Belgian eID card by providing virtual cards to use in
your tests.

The 'trick' is to let your test app or lib use the proxy
PCSC lib (/usr/share/eidtestinfra/libpcsclite.so) instead
of the regular PCSC lib (libpcsclite.so, usually in /usr/lib).

You can do this by putting /usr/share/beid_testinfra
as the first path in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable. In the case the PCSC lib is dynamically loaded,
you additionally have to add the following to the LD_PRELOAD
environment variable: /usr/share/eidtestinfra/libdl_proxy.so

The proxy PCSC lib will emulate virtual cards in virtual
smart card readers. The data from those virtual cards is
read from 'virtual card contents files' on the hard disk.

To use the pcsccontrol tool you need to have a Java(tm)
runtime (JRE) installed on your system. The preferred Java(tm)
version is 6 or later. See http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/

For more info, see https://env.dev.eid.belgium.be

On this site, you can also order a test card and generate
virtual card content files for that test card.

Installation
============

On a command shell, 'cd' to this directory and type
  sudo ./install.sh

Quick start guide
=================

This assumes you already have a physical test card.

1. Generate a virtual card contents file for this test card
   e.g. with friendly name "barbara", and save it to e.g. /tmp
   See "Generating virtuals cards" below for more info.

2. Select this virtual card contents file:
   - On a command shell, type /usr/share/eidtestinfra/pcsccontrol.sh
     (see REMARK below)
   - Select Options - Virtual Card Include Directories,
     and add /tmp
   - Right-click on "barbara" and select "Set Active"
   - Select Options - Card Reader Visibility - Hide physical
     card reader
   - Select File - Save

3. Download the BE eID middleware (this is the application
   that we will test)

4. Change your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. E.g. for bash:
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/share/eidtestinfra
   (In the case of an application that loads the PCSC proxy dynamically,
    e.g. when using javax.smartcardio with the JRE, you should do this
    command as well:
      export LD_PRELOAD="/usr/share/eidtestinfra/libdl_proxy.so /usr/share/eidtestinfra/libpcsclite.so"
   )

5. Tell the middleware to accept test cards: in ~/.config/beid.conf,
   add the following  to the [certificatevalidation] section:
     cert_allow_testcard=1

6. On the same command shell, type 'beidgui' to start the BE
   eID GUI. You will now see the virtual card that you generated.
   If yo select Tools - Options and look at the available readers,
   you will only see the virtual smart card reader (whose
   name starts with "!Virtual").

REMARK: the pcsccontrol tool may not work with GNU java. In this
case download Sun's JRE 1.6 (or 1.5) and set the JAVA_HOME to it.
For example:    export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jre1.6.0_10/

Generating virtual cards
========================

To generate virtual cards you need a test card, that you
can purchase from https://env.dev.eid.belgium.be. 

You can then use that test card to log in to the "Online
Configuration" part of this website to generate and download
virtual cards (which is an xml file).

To log with the test card, you could download the BE eID
middleware from http://eid.belgium.be/. This site also contains
info on how to log in using Firefox, Safari or Internet Explorer.
