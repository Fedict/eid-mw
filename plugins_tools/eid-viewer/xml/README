The files in this directory show how to create a drag-and-drop data
receiver for the eid-viewer XML file format.

Present are:

- dnd.html: HTML file with some javascript that demonstrates how the
  drag-and-drop is supposed to work
- bg.jpg, teleport.png: used by dnd.html
- eidv4.xsd: defines the XML format as exported by the eid viewer. This
  is not used by dnd.html, passed on only informationally.

To use this, do the following:
- open dnd.html in a web browser
- open the eid-viewer, and make sure it has data (either read from a
  card, or from a file)
- drag the photo from the viewer onto the web browser.
- Alternatively, choose File->Save in the eid viewer, and drop the saved
  file onto the web browser.

WARNING WARNING WARNING

While the approach demonstrated here works and is supported, it is NOT a
secure proof of identity. That is, the XML data that is dropped by the
eid-viewer is not cryptographically signed, and can be trivially
modified by the user.

If you need proof of identity rather than an easy to use alternative
method to manually filling out a web form, this is not the thing to use.
